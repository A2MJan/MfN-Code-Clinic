* Neil wants to review the code from a publication. The code uses `foreach`, and thus is quite unusual in its syntax.
* Follow-up on R phylogenies sessions from last spring: rewrite together a `read.nexus` function that can catch all variations of this format and be compatible with main phylogeny-based R packages such ape, paleotree, dispRity, Claddis, etc. (JR)
